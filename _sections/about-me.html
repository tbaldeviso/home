  <p>I'm a Computer Science Alumni from UC Davis actively looking for positions in Software Engineering.
  I have a passion for all things coding and am willing to gain experience in it wherever I can.  Besides coursework
 I have been developing this website and the games posted on here and will continue to do so.</p>
